> Surge pricing significantly increases the supply of rides on the Uber system. 

While there is broad consensus among economists that platforms like
Uber increases consumer welfare, less attention has been paid to its effects on
the labor market in terms of earnings, work flexibility, and overall efficiency.

This paper aims to measure how the dynamic pricing of tasks on online
“sharing” and “gig” economy platforms influence the supply of labor on the
intensive margin.

Central to this question are the characteristics of workers’
labor supply elasticities; that is, the responsiveness of supply hours to changes in
the prevailing price of services. We measure and characterize these elasticities for
drivers on the UberX platform, and find significantly and substantially positive
supply elasticities. 

> Supply Elasticities?

Naturally, the direction of labor supply elasticities holds strong implications
for the effectiveness of a dynamic labor-pricing mechanism. 
Employing surge pricing to incentivize the suppy of services could push more supply off the system than on, potentially exacerbating the supply/demand imbalance. 

> Surge pricing of Uber?

Surge pricing is the output of an algorithm which automatically raises the price of a trip when demand outstrips supply within a
fixed geographic area. Trip prices are adjusted by multiplying the prices of the
underlying components which make up fare –the base fare, the price per mile,
and the price per minute–10 by a multiplier output by the surge algorithm.

This
multiplier is communicated to both riders and partners before each trip is initiated; riders see and must confirm.

> Conceptualization of Uber partner's SHIFT

A unique challenge of this dataset is the conceptualization of a partner’s “workday” or “shift”. In contrast to papers studying the labor supply of taxi drivers,
the lack of organizational constraints on time worked implies that the supply
choices of Uber partners need not resemble a typical workday. While this flexibility provides driver-partners with a clear benefit, it poses an analytic challenge in
defining the correct unit of time for analysis, particularly for an income-targeting
hypothesis.

> Surge multiplier

One concern about the results presented thus far is that, even given the strong
level of fixed effects and controls already imposed, there may be underlying
unobserved elements driving both the change in surge multiplier and a partner’s
decision to stop; thus, the effect of the surge multiplier may be biased.
